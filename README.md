## Autonomous Robot Navigation and Path Optimization Using RRT and TEB in ROS and Gazebo

This project involves implementing an autonomous robot navigation system in a simulated environment using ROS Noetic and Gazebo. The primary focus is on path planning and optimization utilizing the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for global planning and the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) algorithm for local path optimization and obstacle avoidance. The implementation includes setting up ROS parameters, resetting the simulation environment, generating and visualizing occupancy maps, and executing the navigation plan while dynamically adjusting to changes in the environment. The project leverages ROS Noetic packages for seamless integration and operation.
